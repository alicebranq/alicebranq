Web Developer based in Brazil ðŸ¦œ

Developer, Data Analyst (in the making) and History student, I'm passionate about discovering new things! 

I've completed Resilia's *Full-stack Web Development* course in September 2022. In March 2023 I started the higher technology course in *System Analysis and Development* at IBMR, to deepen my knowledge.

Looking for new experiences to learn new skills in practice and improve the ones I already have.
 
Be welcome and take your time! Maybe you'll find something interesting here.
